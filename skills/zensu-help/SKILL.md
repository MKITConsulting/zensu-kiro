# /zensu-help

Answer questions about how Zensu (the SaaS Product Lifecycle Manager) and the zensu-kiro plugin itself work. Acts as an in-conversation glossary, architecture explainer, and config reference — does NOT execute workflows.

## When to Use

- User asks "what is X?", "how does Y work?", "where is Z configured?"
- User asks about plugin internals: agents, hooks, FSM, auto-fix loop, MCP server
- User asks about Zensu concepts: features, ZEN-XXX, tiers, journeys, classifications
- User asks "what changed in version X" or "how do I disable hook Y"
- User is unsure which other skill (`bootstrap` vs `ghost-scan` vs `implement`) applies to their situation

## Do NOT Use For

- Executing workflows → use `/zensu-bootstrap`, `/zensu-ghost-scan`, `/zensu-implement`, `/zensu-security-review`, `/zensu-pulse`, `/zensu-reset-review-limit`
- Modifying Zensu data — this skill is read-only Q&A

## Prerequisites

None. This skill answers from embedded knowledge and the plugin's canonical docs already present in the repository. No MCP connection, no API key, no network required.

## Core Glossary (embedded — stable concepts)

- **Product** — top-level container; owns Components, Tiers, Features, Journeys.
- **Component** — architectural module within a Product (e.g. `auth-service`).
- **Feature** — unit of capability, identified by `ZEN-XXX` (e.g. `ZEN-001`). Lifecycle: `planned → in-progress → testing → released`.
- **Tier** — pricing/availability level (e.g. Free, Pro, Team). Features map to tiers via the tier matrix.
- **Journey** — user path through one or more Features; contributes to release readiness.
- **Security Classification** — `public | internal | confidential | restricted`. Drives the 0–10 security score.
- **Security Score** — computed from classification + OWASP tags + compliance tags + security tests + reviews.
- **Revision** — a Feature's build-out *stage* over time. Auto-versioned (v1, v2, …); each tracks scope changes, acceptance criteria, breaking changes, effort, and target release. v1 is the baseline stage; later revisions are deeper build-out. `/zensu-ghost-scan` seats each discovered feature at a v1 baseline; `/zensu-implement` adds one per implementation.
- **Subfeature** — *structural* fan-out of a Feature into child parts (same component + release): workflow steps, happy-vs-error paths, interface or data variations. A feature's two growth axes are revisions (stages over time) and subfeatures (parts); both differ from the product-level roadmap (features across a quarter timeline).

## Three Layers (embedded — architecture overview)

1. **Planning** (`zensu-plm` agent) — `/zensu-bootstrap` (greenfield: a plan/vision doc, no code yet) or `/zensu-ghost-scan` (brownfield: an existing codebase) produce tracked features, user journeys, and linked docs. **Hybrid** (existing code *and* a forward plan doc): ghost-scan first to import what is built, then create the plan's not-yet-built items as `planned` features. The agent triages by asking: (1) code already built or starting fresh? (2) plan/vision doc present? (3) if both, does the plan describe things not yet built?
2. **Implementation** (`/zensu-tdd` skill in the MAIN thread + `zensu-code-reviewer` subagent) — strict RED→IMPL→GREEN TDD enforced by a PreToolUse FSM gate, followed by 5 sequential code-review perspectives, then an auto-fix loop guaranteed by the `Stop` hook (`stop-chain-enforcer.sh`). Since upstream (zensu-claude-code) 0.4.0 the TDD workflow runs in the main agent (was a `tdd-manager` subagent); `zensu-code-reviewer` is the only subagent the TDD chain spawns directly (zensu-plm and zensu-review-aspect are the other shipped subagents).
3. **Tracking** — web dashboard surfaces security scores, journey health, tier matrix, coverage trends.

## Agents (embedded — one-liners)

- `zensu-review-aspect` — read-only single-perspective reviewer; five run in parallel during the TDD review fan-out.
- `zensu-plm` — orchestrates planning workflows (bootstrap, ghost-scan, security review, release readiness).
- `zensu-code-reviewer` — single READ-ONLY subagent running 5 sequential perspectives: conventions, bugs, architecture, tests, security.

TDD discipline (RED→IMPL→GREEN, FSM-gated edits, 3-retry IMPL escalation, completeness audit) is NOT a subagent — it runs in the main thread via the `/zensu-tdd` skill (migrated from the `tdd-manager` subagent in upstream zensu-claude-code 0.4.0).

## Topic Routing (live read for volatile facts)

Before answering questions in the right column, `Read` the source file in the left column and quote `file:line` in the answer.

| Question type | Source to Read |
|---|---|
| Plugin version | `VERSION` + `POWER.md` (frontmatter `metadata.version`) |
| Declared skills/agents/hooks wiring | `agents/cli/zensu.json` (hooks live inside the agent config) + `skills/` dirs |
| MCP server URL, MCP tool surface | `mcp.json` + `hooks/lib/zensu-mcp-tools.sh` (read/mutation classification) |
| Hook flags (`chainEnforcer`, `autoFix`, `autoFixIncludeSuggestions`, `autoFixMaxRounds`, `combinedSummary`, `pulseSession`, `sessionBanner`, `tddReminder`, `intentRouter`, `mcpGate`, `selfReview`) | `README.md` § Configuration + `config.example.json` |
| Context-nudge settings (`context.*`) | `config.example.json` + `hooks/user-prompt-context-nudge.sh` (inert on Kiro — see README fidelity matrix) |
| Config resolution order, `ZENSU_CONFIG` precedence | `hooks/lib/zensu-config.sh` (header comment) |
| Environment variables (`ZENSU_API_KEY`, `ZENSU_TDD_GATE`, `ZENSU_TEST_WITNESS`, `ZENSU_CHAIN`, `ZENSU_MCP_GATE`, `KIRO_API_KEY`) | `README.md` § Configuration + § Headless |
| TDD FSM details, phase transitions, gate logic, three-channel logging | `docs/tdd-manager-workflow.md` + `steering/zensu-tdd-protocol.md` |
| Documentation: doc types, how to write code-grounded feature/wiki docs | `docs/documentation-guide.md` |
| Hook scripts (what each does, when it fires) | `README.md` § What you get (Hooks row) + `hooks/<script>.sh` source |
| Pulse session lifecycle | `skills/zensu-pulse/SKILL.md` |
| Resetting the auto-fix rounds counter / "max rounds reached" recovery | `skills/zensu-reset-review-limit/SKILL.md` + `hooks/post-review-tdd-delegate.sh` (convergence branch) |
| Greenfield vs brownfield vs hybrid; feature build-out stages (revisions) & fan-out | Core Glossary (above) + `agents/prompts/zensu-plm.md` § Decision Rules |
| "What changed in version X" | `CHANGELOG.md` (search for `[X.Y.Z]`) |
| License / Permitted Purpose / Competing Use | `README.md` § License + `LICENSE` file |
| Platform support, Windows caveats | `README.md` § Windows |
| IDE vs CLI capability differences | `README.md` § Claude Code → Kiro fidelity matrix + `POWER.md` fidelity note |

## Response Style

- Cite sources as `README.md:200` or `docs/tdd-manager-workflow.md`.
- If the embedded glossary fully answers it → answer directly, no Read needed.
- If a routed source applies → Read first, quote facts verbatim, cite.
- Never invent tool names, hook names, config flags, or version numbers — verify via Read.
- If a question falls outside this skill's scope (e.g. "implement feature ZEN-042"), point the user at the right action skill instead of half-answering.
- Match the conversational register — terse if the user is terse, fuller if they ask "explain in detail".
