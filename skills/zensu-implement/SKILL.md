# /zensu-implement

Implement a tracked Zensu feature end-to-end. Loads feature context and security profile, then runs disciplined implementation via the **`/zensu-tdd` skill** in the main thread (strict RED-GREEN TDD, PreToolUse phase-gate, guaranteed code-review chain). After TDD completes, links all artifacts and creates a revision.

## When to Use

- Starting implementation of a planned feature
- Resuming work on an in-progress feature
- Completing a feature with proper artifact linking

## Prerequisites

- Zensu CLI installed (`curl -fsSL https://zensu.dev/install.sh | sh`) and authenticated (`zensu auth login`)
- `ZENSU_API_KEY` environment variable set
- A feature ID (KEY-N format, e.g. ZEN-42, or UUID) to implement

Every command accepts `--json` for machine-readable output; run `zensu <noun> <verb> --help` for the full flag set.

## Workflow

**Workflow gate (first + last action).** As the VERY FIRST action, run `bash "$(cat "$HOME/.zensu/plugin-root")/hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh" --workflow-begin --tools "analyze_feature_security,link_test,link_source_files,bulk_link_source_files,link_docs,create_wiki_page,create_revision,update_feature"`. This marks the Zensu product workflow active so the CLI write-gate (`hooks.mcpGate`, default-on) recognizes this skill's `zensu link test` / `zensu link source` / `zensu link docs` / `zensu features revision` commands as workflow-driven rather than freelance and does not block them. As the VERY LAST action (after Step 8, or on early exit), run `bash "$(cat "$HOME/.zensu/plugin-root")/hooks/lib/zensu-log.sh" --workflow-end`.

### Step 1: Load Feature Context

1. Ask the user for the feature ID
2. Run `zensu features get <feature-id> --json` to load the full feature details (title, description, status, priority, product, component, security classification). The JSON response includes the `product_id` and `component_id` (when set) that Step 5 needs.
3. Run `zensu security analyze <feature-id>` to load the security context (classification, data sensitivity, OWASP tags, compliance requirements, score)
4. Run `zensu mocks list <feature-id>` to discover per-feature UI mocks. For each **HTML** mock, pull its markup with `zensu mocks get <feature-id> <mock-id> --raw` and keep it as the visual/structural target the implementation must match. For **image** mocks, note their titles and that a visual reference exists (the raw bytes are not actionable as text). If no mocks are returned, this feature has none — continue normally; mocks are optional context, never a blocker.
5. Run `zensu design context <product-id>` to load the product/component design system (Design.md guidance + shared CSS + image-asset references), taking `<product-id>` from the `product_id` in Step 2's JSON output; when that response also carries a `component_id`, add `--component <component-id>`. The implementation must conform to this design system. If the product has no design context, continue normally; the design system is optional context, never a blocker.
6. Run `zensu knowledge search --query "<feature title + key terms>"` to surface related org context — existing features, visions, journeys, and connected sources — so the implementation builds on what the org already knows. It is retrieval-only: synthesize from the returned passages and cite their provenance.
7. Present a summary to the user:
   - Feature title and description
   - Current status and priority
   - Security classification and constraints
   - Any security requirements that must be addressed during implementation
   - Available UI mocks (HTML markup loaded, image titles noted) and whether a product/component design system is present

### Step 2: Implementation Planning

Based on the feature context and security profile, help the user plan the implementation:
- Identify files to create or modify
- Note security constraints from the classification (e.g., input validation required, audit logging needed)
- Consider the OWASP tags and compliance requirements
- Outline the implementation approach
- When mocks were loaded in Step 1, the implementation MUST match them visually and structurally: reproduce the HTML mock's layout, structure, and component hierarchy, and treat image-mock titles as the target visual. When a design system was loaded, the implementation MUST conform to it — reuse the shared CSS and follow the Design.md guidance instead of inventing new styles. When neither is present, proceed normally; these are optional context, never a hard blocker.

If the feature's security classification is confidential or restricted, emphasize:
- Input validation on all user inputs
- Proper authentication and authorization checks
- Data encryption requirements
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

### Step 3: Implement via the /zensu-tdd skill

Invoke the **`/zensu-tdd` skill** (slash invocation) with a feature specification built from Steps 1-2 as the input. Include the feature title, description, component, security classification, security constraints from Step 1, and the implementation plan from Step 2. End the spec with: "Reference this feature as [KEY-N] (the feature's actual id, e.g. [ZEN-42]) in all commit messages." You run the TDD workflow yourself in THIS main thread — do not spawn a subagent.

If the TDD workflow cannot proceed or all steps are blocked, continue manually from Step 4.

The /zensu-tdd workflow will:
- Split the work into atomic steps and classify each (Feature / Refactor / Bug-fix / Integration)
- Create a plan document in `.zensu/plans/`
- Execute strict RED-GREEN TDD cycles in-thread, enforced by the PreToolUse phase-gate (or direct vanilla implementation when `hooks.tddImplementation` is `false` — the skill branches itself at `--tdd-begin`)
- Run a completeness audit at the end (build, coverage, mtime, precondition drift)
- Provide a progress log at `.zensu/logs/`

At the end of the workflow (Phase 6) it marks implementation complete and spawns `@zensu-code-reviewer` for the 5-perspective review. The `Stop` hook (`stop-chain-enforcer.sh`) guarantees the review chain runs, and `post-review-tdd-delegate.sh` routes any findings back for in-thread fixing until PASS or max rounds.

**For trivial changes** (single-line fix, config change, migration-only): Skip the /zensu-tdd skill and implement directly, then continue with Step 4.

### Step 4: Link Tests

For each test file written (by the /zensu-tdd workflow or manually), run `zensu link test <feature-id>` with:
- `--test-type` (required): unit | integration | e2e | security | performance | accessibility
- `--file` (required): Path to the test file
- `--function` (optional): Specific test function
- `--last-run-status` (optional): passed | failed | skipped

### Step 5: Link Source Files

Run `zensu link source <feature-id>` to map implementation files to the feature. Pass each file with a repeatable `--file` flag in the form `path[:type[:language[:linecount]]]` (type: source | test | config | migration | docs | generated | other). For cross-feature mapping, run `zensu link source` once per target feature id.

### Step 6: Documentation

Documentation must be **code-grounded** — written from the real source you just
implemented, not a restatement of the feature record.
**Read `docs/documentation-guide.md`** first, then follow it:

1. Run `zensu doc gen-context <feature-id> --doc-type <type>` for the context *map*
   (source-file paths, symbols, security posture), not the source.
2. **Read the real source files it names** (the files linked in Step 5). The map
   is not the territory.
3. Author Markdown grounded in real signatures, endpoints, and behavior, matched
   to the doc type's focus and audience. Do NOT condense the context metadata
   into `## Purpose / ## Source files / ## Security / ## Notes` sections — that
   metadata dump is the exact failure this step prevents.
4. Publish with `zensu wiki create --product <product-id> --title <title> --content <markdown>`
   (plus `--entity-type`, `--entity-id`, `--doc-type`, `--audience`).

Then register the doc with `zensu link docs <feature-id>` (updates the feature's docs score):
- `--doc-type` (required): user_facing | api_reference | tutorial | adr | internal | release_notes | migration_guide | overview
- `--title` (optional): Document title
- `--file` (optional): Path to the doc file
- `--external-url` (optional): External URL
- `--audience` (optional): end_user | developer | admin | internal
- `--publication-status` (optional): draft | published | archived

Run `zensu link docs` alone (no wiki page) only for docs that already live in the repo
or at an external URL.

### Step 7: Create Revision

Run `zensu features revision <feature-id>` to version the implementation:
- `--scope-summary` (required): Brief summary of what was implemented
- `--scope-details` (optional): Detailed scope description
- `--estimated-effort` (optional): S | M | L | XL
- `--coverage-target` (optional): Target coverage percentage (0-100)
- `--docs-required` (optional): Whether docs are required for this revision
- `--created-by` (optional): identifier for who created the revision

### Step 8: Validate

Run `zensu security validate <feature-id>` to check if the implementation meets all security requirements for release.

Present the validation results:
- Security score
- Release gate status (pass/fail)
- Any remaining violations to address

### Summary

Present a completion summary:
- Feature title and what was implemented
- Files created/modified (source files linked)
- Tests written and linked (with pass/fail status)
- Documentation linked
- Revision created (version number)
- Security validation status
- TDD report: steps completed, attempts, blocked steps (if any)

## Important Notes

- `zensu features update` does NOT change status. Status transitions (planned -> in-progress -> testing -> released) go through `zensu features status <feature-id> <new-status>`.
- Always reference the feature ID in commit messages: `feat(component): description [KEY-N]`
- Security classification should be set BEFORE implementation (use `/zensu-security-review` if not yet set)
- The /zensu-tdd workflow creates a plan at `.zensu/plans/{timestamp}_tdd-{feature-slug}.md` and a progress log at `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-.}/.zensu/logs/{timestamp}_tdd-{feature-slug}.log`
