# /zensu-pulse

Your Developer Journal: privacy-first session tracking that helps you understand your development patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Zensu CLI installed (`curl -fsSL https://zensu.dev/install.sh | sh`) and authenticated (`zensu auth login`)
- Git repository (for HEAD SHA and branch context)

## When to Use

Run this workflow at the start and end of each coding session. Pulse records your session boundaries and which features you touch — never code content, only file paths and session metadata.

## Phase 1: Session Start

At the beginning of your coding session:

1. Get the current git HEAD SHA: `git rev-parse HEAD`
2. Get the current branch: `git branch --show-current`
3. Run `zensu pulse start` with:
   - `--head-sha`: the HEAD SHA
   - `--branch`: current branch name
   - `--project`: absolute path to the project root
   - `--product`: (optional) Zensu product UUID if known
4. Save the returned `session_id` for use during the session

Sessions are idempotent — calling with the same `--head-sha` returns the existing session, so it's safe to call multiple times.

## Phase 2: During Work

Work as normal. Pulse captures the session at its boundaries (start in Phase 1, end in Phase 3) — there is no per-command logging step to run. At session end the changed files you report are mapped to the features they touch.

**Privacy controls:**
- Only structured data is recorded (session metadata, feature IDs, file paths)
- Code content is never recorded
- Error messages are only logged if the user has enabled `freetext_logging`
- Users can disable tracking entirely via privacy settings

## Phase 3: Session End & Review

When wrapping up your coding session:

1. Get changed files: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` (or since session start SHA)
2. Run `zensu pulse end <session-id>` with:
   - `--changed-files`: comma-separated list of changed file paths
3. Zensu automatically maps changed files -> features via `feature_source_files`
4. Run `zensu pulse summary <session-id>` to review:
   - Total duration
   - Activity recorded
   - Which features were touched

## Privacy First

Pulse is designed as "Your Developer Journal" — personal and private by default:

- **Tracking**: Can be disabled entirely (no data recorded)
- **Freetext**: Error messages stripped unless explicitly opted in
- **Team visibility**: Off by default — your sessions are only visible to you
- **Retention**: Data auto-expires after 90 days (configurable)

Manage privacy settings via the Zensu web UI or API.

## Example Session Flow

```
# Start of day
> zensu pulse start --head-sha abc123 --branch feat/auth --project /home/dev/myapp

# ... work on features, create revisions, run security reviews ...

# End of day
> zensu pulse end <session-id> --changed-files src/auth.go,src/auth_test.go,src/middleware.go

# Review what you accomplished
> zensu pulse summary <session-id>
```

## CLI Commands Used

| Command | Phase | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `zensu pulse start` | 1 | Start session with git HEAD and branch |
| `zensu pulse end` | 3 | End session with changed file paths |
| `zensu pulse summary` | 3 | Review session activity breakdown |
