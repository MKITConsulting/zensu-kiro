Your Developer Journal: privacy-first session tracking that helps you understand your development patterns.

## Prerequisites

- Zensu MCP Server connected (plugin auto-configures via `.mcp.json`)
- `ZENSU_API_KEY` environment variable set (or OAuth browser login)
- Git repository (for HEAD SHA and branch context)

## When to Use

Run this workflow at the start and end of each coding session. Pulse automatically tracks which MCP tools you use and which features you touch — never code content, only file paths and tool names.

## Phase 1: Session Start

At the beginning of your coding session:

1. Get the current git HEAD SHA: `git rev-parse HEAD`
2. Get the current branch: `git branch --show-current`
3. Call `pulse_start_session` with:
   - `head_sha`: the HEAD SHA
   - `branch`: current branch name
   - `project_path`: absolute path to the project root
   - `product_id`: (optional) Zensu product UUID if known
4. Save the returned `session_id` for use during the session

Sessions are idempotent — calling with the same `head_sha` returns the existing session, so it's safe to call multiple times.

## Phase 2: During Work (Automatic)

While you work, Zensu automatically logs each MCP tool call:
- Tool name and category
- Duration in milliseconds
- Success/failure status
- Associated feature IDs (when tools operate on features)

No manual action required. The logging middleware captures this transparently.

**Privacy controls:**
- Only structured data is logged (tool names, feature IDs, file paths)
- Code content is never recorded
- Error messages are only logged if the user has enabled `freetext_logging`
- Users can disable tracking entirely via privacy settings

## Phase 3: Session End & Review

When wrapping up your coding session:

1. Get changed files: `git diff --name-only HEAD~1` (or since session start SHA)
2. Call `pulse_end_session` with:
   - `session_id`: from Phase 1
   - `changed_files`: comma-separated list of changed file paths
3. Zensu automatically maps changed files -> features via `feature_source_files`
4. Call `pulse_session_summary` with the `session_id` to review:
   - Total duration
   - Number of tool calls
   - Which features were touched
   - Tool call breakdown by category

## Privacy First

Pulse is designed as "Your Developer Journal" — personal and private by default:

- **Tracking**: Can be disabled entirely (no data recorded)
- **Freetext**: Error messages stripped unless explicitly opted in
- **Team visibility**: Off by default — your sessions are only visible to you
- **Retention**: Data auto-expires after 90 days (configurable)

Manage privacy settings via the Zensu web UI or API.

## Example Session Flow

```
# Start of day
> pulse_start_session head_sha=abc123 branch=feat/auth project_path=/home/dev/myapp

# ... work on features, create revisions, run security reviews ...
# (tool calls are automatically logged)

# End of day
> pulse_end_session session_id=<id> changed_files=src/auth.go,src/auth_test.go,src/middleware.go

# Review what you accomplished
> pulse_session_summary session_id=<id>
```

## MCP Tools Used

| Tool | Phase | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `pulse_start_session` | 1 | Start session with git HEAD and branch |
| `pulse_end_session` | 3 | End session with changed file paths |
| `pulse_session_summary` | 3 | Review session activity breakdown |
