# /zensu-pr-fix-findings

Resolve **every open review comment** on a pull request: implement each fix through
the Zensu workflow, parallelize independent fixes, push, resolve the threads on the
PR, and report back.

## When to Use

- A PR has review comments / change requests you want addressed in one pass.
- You want iterative, repeatable cleanup of review feedback.
- Reviewer left inline findings across several files and the fixes are mostly independent.

Not for: authoring a new review (use `/zensu-pr-team-review`), or planning unbuilt
work (use `/zensu-bootstrap`).

## Prerequisites

- `gh` CLI authenticated (`gh auth status`).
- Zensu CLI installed and authenticated (`zensu auth status`; `zensu auth login` if needed).
- The current branch has an open PR, or a PR number is supplied as an argument.

## Arguments

- Optional PR number to target. Omitted → the PR for the current branch.

## Procedure

1. **Locate the PR.**
   - With a PR number: `gh pr view <n> --json number,url,state,headRefName,baseRefName`.
   - Otherwise: `gh pr view --json number,url,state,headRefName,baseRefName` (current branch).
   - If no PR exists or `state != OPEN`: stop and report. Never push to a closed/merged PR.

2. **Collect unresolved feedback.**
   - Inline review comments: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/comments --paginate`.
   - Unresolved review threads (authoritative for resolution state) via GraphQL —
     `reviewThreads { isResolved, isOutdated, comments { body, path, line, author } }`;
     keep only `isResolved == false`.
   - Top-level review bodies: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<n>/reviews`.
   - Build a worklist of actionable items. Skip pure praise, already-addressed, and outdated-and-moot threads.

3. **Triage for parallelism.**
   - Group items by independence. Items touching disjoint files/concerns are
     independent → safe to fix in parallel. Items on the same file/region or with
     ordering dependencies → sequential.
   - When several items are independent, fan them out across parallel subagents (one
     per item or cluster, isolated worktrees if they edit files concurrently). A
     single small item does not need fan-out — fix it inline.

4. **Implement each fix via the Zensu workflow.**
   - Code changes go through the Zensu workflow (`/zensu-tdd`) so the evidence audit
     + review chain run. For parallel fan-out, each agent implements its item and
     returns a structured result (files changed, what was fixed, residual risk).
   - After edits: run the relevant type-check / tests. Fix what you broke.

5. **Land the changes.**
   - Re-verify the PR is still OPEN (`gh pr view --json state`) before pushing.
   - Commit with a Conventional Commit message referencing the addressed comments,
     push to the PR branch. Clean commit messages — no watermark / co-author lines.

6. **Resolve the threads.**
   - For each addressed thread: reply to the comment with a one-line note on the fix
     (commit SHA), then resolve it via GraphQL `resolveReviewThread`.
   - Leave threads you could NOT resolve open, with a reply explaining why or what
     decision you need.

7. **Report back.**
   - Summary table: comment → action taken → commit → resolved?
   - Call out anything that needs a human decision, anything skipped, and the
     test / type-check results.

## Loop behaviour

When invoked repeatedly (e.g. under a loop runner): each iteration re-fetches
unresolved threads.

- If **none remain**, report "all review comments resolved" and stop.
- Otherwise address the next batch and continue.

Stop early and ask the user when you hit a fix that needs a product/architecture
decision, an auth error (`zensu auth login`), or a failing gate you cannot satisfy.
